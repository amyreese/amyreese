# Amethyst Reese ðŸŒ¸

I am a senior engineer, writing Python professionally since 2010, and working on foundational infrastructure and tooling to support thousands of engineers, data scientists, and ML researchers. I am also the maintainer of numerous open source libraries on PyPI, and an experienced speaker from Python conferences and meetups around the world.
